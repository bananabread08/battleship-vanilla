## Features

- Ability to randomly set-up Ships at the start (Rotate and Place Ships accordingly).
- Generate Player Name/s and play Battleship vs. a CPU.
- To be added in the future: drag & drop to place ships.

## Objectives and Outcomes

- Project is mainly to practice, to apply, and to learn more about Test Driven Development.

## Development

This is originally made with React but I had problems with rendering. I opted to just use VanillaJS to finish the project. Got to review some OOP principles, got better at using Jest for Testing (TDD), and relearn some CSS concepts.

Built With:

- HTML + CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- eslint/prettier
- Jest for Testing
